# GPA Calculator
A small program that calculates your GPA. This calculator was based on Istanbul University's grading system where:

- AA: 4.0
- BA: 3.5
- BB: 3.0
- CB: 2.5
- CC: 2.0
- DC: 1.5
- DD: 1.0
- FD: 0.0
- FF: 0.0

Currently the calculator is in English. I plan to localize it to Turkish at a near future.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Information
To run the program just run GPACalculator.py.
